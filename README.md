# Ly_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Summary of Code: Our final project is a Solar System Data system. We are using a Linked list as our Data Structure. Each nod in the list includes: planet name, color, diameter of planet, type of planet,length of year in days, distance from the sun, and a random fact.  With this linked list it will build the solar system and you can print out the order of the system, find a planet and get information about it, find the closest planet to another planet, find the distance between planets, add a planet to the solar system, print a randoma fact about a planet, and print the solar system from iggest to smalles.

Directions for Use:  The code read in the file SolarSystemData.txt so that when you select build Solar System it will build the linked list from information on the file. Once running the user will be promted to select what the user would like to do with the data.

Files needed for code to run: SolarSystemData.txt, main.cpp, SolarSystem.cpp, and SolarSystem.h

System Requirements: This project will work on any system

Group Members: Julio Lemos, Souneth Ly

Open Issues/Bugs: If user preses option 1(Build Solar System) more than once the user will get a seg fault.
