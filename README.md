# Ly_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Our final project is a Solar System Data system. We are using a Linked list as our Data Structure. Each nod in the list includes: planet name, color, diameter of planet, type of planet,length of year in days, distance from the sun, and a random fact.  With this linked list it will build the solar system and you can print out the order of the system, find a planet and get information about it, find the closest planet to another planet, find the distance between planets, add a planet to the solar system, print a randoma fact about a planet, and print the solar system from iggest to smalles.
